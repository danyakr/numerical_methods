# numerical_methods
A repository that implements some numerical methods for calculating integrals. 
There are such calculation methods as: rectangles of the left and right parts, trapezoids, Simpson. 
It is also possible to carry out calculations with a given accuracy; for this purpose, 
the calculation of the remainder term (for the method of rectangles of the left sides) and 
the double recalculation algorithm are implemented. The program also allows you to calculate multiple integrals.
You can also solve differential equations using the Euler method or the Runge-Kutta method. Implemented Euler's method for electron second order, Runge-Kutta method for initial second order and solution of systems of differential equations.
The following approximate methods are supported for solving systems of nonlinear equations: the bisection method, the chord method and the tangent method.
There are functions for finding the approximate value of some specific elementary functions, using two methods: Chebyshev and iterations.
